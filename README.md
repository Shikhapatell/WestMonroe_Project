**data engineering intern**  
📍 chicago, il • 🗓️ june 2024 – august 2024

as a data engineering intern at west monroe, i worked on building modern, scalable data infrastructure to support client-facing analytics and reporting. my work focused on end-to-end pipeline design, data modeling, and orchestration using industry-standard tools and cloud platforms.

### 🛠️ key contributions

- developed and optimized **delta lake** pipelines in **databricks** using **sql** and **python**, streamlining ingestion, transformation, and delivery of high-volume data from multiple sources. improved data reliability and freshness across environments.
- designed and implemented the **medallion architecture** (**bronze → silver → gold** layers) to clean, refine, and standardize raw data. enabled traceability and reproducibility across the data lifecycle.
- automated **etl workflows** using **apache airflow** for job scheduling and monitoring. used **dbt (data build tool)** for transformation logic, applying modular sql models and maintaining version-controlled, testable pipelines.
- enhanced **query performance and cost-efficiency** by optimizing **amazon redshift** clusters. adjusted distribution/sort keys, implemented workload management (wlm), and improved table structure for analytical workloads.
- collaborated with cross-functional teams to understand data requirements and build scalable solutions that met business needs while adhering to best practices in data governance and quality.

### ⚙️ tech stack

- **databricks** • **delta lake** • **apache spark** • **python** • **sql**
- **dbt** • **apache airflow** • **amazon redshift**
- **medallion architecture** • **etl orchestration** • **data modeling**

### 🧠 focus areas

- scalable data pipelines  
- orchestration and automation  
- performance tuning and cost optimization  
- modern data architecture  
- warehouse analytics and transformation logic

this experience strengthened my understanding of **real-world data architecture patterns**, pipeline observability, and the impact of data engineering on business insights and strategic decision-making.
